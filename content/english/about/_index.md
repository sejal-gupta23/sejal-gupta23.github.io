I am currently working at Hindustan Unilever Ltd. as a Manager in Demand Planning Excellence, focusing on developing **AI algorithms for demand forecasting in both General and E-Commerce trade**. I am enthusiastic about leveraging emerging technologies to tackle complex business challenges and transforming them into impactful, lasting solutions. My key interests include **Behavioral Economics, Consumer Psychology, Advanced Data Analytics, and AI Modeling.**

As I explore this field further, I have come to realize that vast amounts of data often contain inherent biasesâ€”some explicit, but most unconscious. This understanding has deepened my passion for Decision Sciences. I am particularly interested in how data can be utilized to generate meaningful insights while also considering the impact of cognitive biases on engineers, managers, consumers, and creators. Through this project, I aim to share my discoveries and insights with you.

In my free time, I enjoy **dancing, traveling, cooking, and exploring psychology**. I am also passionate about learning new skills and am currently diving into web development.
