I am a **working professional, amateur dancer, and travel enthusiast** with a passion for exploring how data can be leveraged to generate meaningful insights. 

As I dive deeper into this field, I’ve come to realize that with vast amounts of data come inherent biases—some conscious, but most unconscious. This has sparked my interest in decision sciences, particularly in the areas of **behavioral economics, consumer psychology, and artificial intelligence modeling.** Through this passion project, I aim to further explore how these domains intersect and how we can better understand the human factors that influence decision-making.

Alongside, I am also excited trying my hands at **web development!** 

Stay tuned for some exciting insights and discoveries!
