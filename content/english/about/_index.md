I am currently at Hindustan Unilever Ltd., developing **AI algorithms for Demand Forecasting across General and E-Commerce trade**. I am enthusiastic about leveraging emerging technologies to solve complex business problems and transform them into lasting, impactful solutions. My key interests include **Behavioral Economics, Consumer Psychology, Advanced Data Analytics, and AI Modeling**.

As I delve deeper into this field, I’ve realized that vast amounts of data often carry inherent biases—some explicit, but most unconscious. This awareness has fueled my passion for **Decision Sciences**. I am deeply interested in exploring how data can be harnessed to generate meaningful insights while understanding the impact of cognitive biases on engineers, managers, consumers, and creators alike. Through this project, I aim to share my discoveries and insights with you!

In my free time, I enjoy **Dancing, Traveling, Cooking, and exploring Psychology**. I’m also passionate about learning new skills and am currently diving into **Web Development**.
