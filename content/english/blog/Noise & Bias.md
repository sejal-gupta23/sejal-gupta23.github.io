An average adult makes about 33,000 to 35,000 daily decisions—ranging from what we eat and what we wear to which source of entertainment we will consume at the end of the day. But are our choices truly our own? Is every decision we make influenced only by the factors we consciously consider, or are there hidden forces at play?

Let’s look at the below image and do an exercise. Which one of the following lines is shorter? 

{{< image src="images/Muller-Lyer1.jpg" caption="[Muller-Lyer Illusion](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-the-muller-lyer-illusion-works-4111110)" alt="alter-text" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q100" class="img-fluid" title="Humans and Rationale?"  webp="false" >}}

Now, since we are doing this exercise here, I guess it is no surprise that all three lines are of the same length. However, if we focus on this image repeatedly for as long as we can, we still continue to perceive the three lines differently—the first one appearing the shortest and the second one the longest. This illusion is famously known as the “Müller-Lyer Illusion” and gives us a glimpse of how something as simple as arrows can create the illusion of varying lengths. This illusion is created due to “”. 

The point being, Cognitive biases are everywhere, shaping our decisions in ways we don’t always realize. These mental shortcuts, often called “biases,” affect our daily lives. For example, a mother may favor her son without noticing, or a campaign manager might believe their marketing plan is great, even if it falls short. But is every mistake really a bias? Or is there more to the story? 

Let’s take a forecasting problem as an example. Imagine five different forecasters predicting how many ice creams will be sold in India in April 2025. Even though they all analyze the same data, it’s almost certain they’ll produce five different forecasts. The gap between their predictions could be as small as 0.1% or as large as 50%. But why does the same sales data lead to such different results when examined by equally skilled forecasters? Is this due to bias? Or is it something else—noise?

But what exactly are bias and noise, and how do they differ? Can the two co-exist?

### Introduction to Noise and Bias

Simply put, noise and bias are two distinct types of errors that affect human judgment. However, in everyday conversations, we often use these terms interchangeably. When we see variations in the predictions of five different forecasters, we might quickly assume they are biased—when in reality, it could just be noise. When a mother favours her child, is her decision biased or noisy? 

Let's understand the definition with an example. (If you’re thinking there are too many examples, it’s because, in my experience, the best way to understand our own biases is by seeing them in action.)

About the image. Now let's look at the back of the images.

Back of the image analysis. 

Forefather of Behavourial Science said, "Wherever there is judgment, there is noise. And more than we can expect. "
