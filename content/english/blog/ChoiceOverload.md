How long did it take for you to decide which movie to watch last time on Netflix? 

Personally, it takes me at least 10-15 mins to choose the “perfect” movie that would suit my current mood, has decent ratings, and an amazing storyline. And most of the time, I end up rewatching an old movie/series just because I couldn't decide which movie to watch! Does this happen with you too?

Every one of us aims to maximize our welfare in every possible way. We want the best of things for ourselves, with whatever limited resources we have! Even businesses aim to maximize their welfare and their customer’s welfare.

> Maximum welfare → requires maximum freedom → need a maximum no of choices → more choices mean we have to choose → make decisions again and again and again!!


Basically, from deciding whether to host your next meeting on MS Teams, Webex or Google meet or choosing which music streaming service to use, we make hundreds of decisions every day.

In his TED talk, Paradox of Choice, Barry Schwartz talks about how choice has made us not freer but more paralyzed, not happier but more dissatisfied. He illustrated this using a simple example! Imagine you’re sick and you visit a doctor. So after your diagnosis, the doc suggests you, “We could do A or we could do B. A has these benefits and these risks. B has these benefits and these risks. What do you want to do?”. Since you don’t have sufficient knowledge in medicine, you ask the doctor, “what should I do?”. The doctor says, “We could do A, or we could do B. A has these benefits and these risks. B has these benefits and these risks.” This demonstrates that we get to decide even those aspects of our lives we don’t have enough knowledge about!

## Introduction

Some choice is definitely better than none. It makes us feel empowered. But more choices are not always better than some choices. These extra choices can make us worse off!

The Paradox of Choice theory tells us that there is a point at which offering too many options makes it difficult to make a decision and that consumers may not make a decision at all as a way of coping. The phenomenon of “choice overload” occurs due to too many choices being available to consumers. 

**Overchoice has been associated with:**
* Unhappiness
* Decision fatigue
* Going with the default option
* Avoiding making the decision altogether

But this may seem contradictory to what most of us believe. We have always thought that more choices are better. It offers the consumers a variety of products to choose from. But then why is it that we seem to suffer due to excess of choices?

1. **Paralysis rather than liberation:** Every time you choose to rewatch an old TV series/movie instead of a new one because you couldn’t decide on a new one is an example of how too many choices can sometimes lead to decision paralysis. Sometimes it may cause us to avoid making the decision altogether.

2. **Escalation of expectations:** When we spend time and effort choosing between various alternatives, we expect our extra efforts to pay-off. This leads to us having higher expectations from the chosen product, which may lead to disappointment.

3. **Less satisfaction if we had fewer choices to choose from:** Suppose you’re unhappy with the product you choose. The more the number of choices to choose from, the more would be the regret from choosing a product you didn’t like as much. This leads to dissatisfaction.

## The Paradox of Choice & Businesses

In finance, the traditional rule of thumb is “Higher is the risk, higher is the reward.” More choices have always been considered good. As a reward for more choices, you might attract more customers. On the other hand, more choices mean carrying the risk of turning the customers off.

Let’s consider the jam experiment that reveals when precisely offering less choice may enhance your sales. Basically, the study found that consumers were 10 times more likely to purchase jam on display when the number of jams available was reduced from 24 to 6.

But many studies support the idea that choices are good and increase consumer’s likelihood of purchasing a product. So, how do we decide as to when is choice good or bad? A paper published in the Journal of Consumer psychology in 2015 successfully isolated four cases when reducing customers' choices is most likely to boost sales.

* When people want to make a quick and easy choice (effort-minimizing goal)
* When making the right choice matters/you are selling complex products (the decision task is difficult)
* When you show options that are difficult to compare (greater choice set complexity)
* When your customers are unclear about their preferences (higher preference uncertainty)

## Conclusion

The paradox of choice is a real phenomenon, and decision-makers must test for it before launching their products in the market. It helps us understand the risk associated with more choices. Having said this, other than the four scenarios mentioned above, choices are considered advantageous & are said to make your product more attractive!

After all, none of us will use Netflix or Amazon Prime if they didn’t offer such a wide variety of movies and shows to watch xD.
